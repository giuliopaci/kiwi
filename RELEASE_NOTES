This release is incompatible with previous releases of kiwi and minor
changes are required to use it.

1) Several functions' prototypes in the C API have been changed to
 make them re-entrant. For this reason these functions requires an
 additional parameter (a pointer to the parser data). Upgrading from a
 previous release you must identify the relevant functions and change
 the code accordingly. Special care must be taken for variable number
 arguments functions (bprintf, append_to_tag_content) as the compiler
 sometime accept the old-style invocation, leading to a segmentation
 fault.
